Subject: Escalating ticket cluster: “search not loading”

Hi team,

We’ve had 70+ users report “Search loading forever” on cellular data. This pattern appears in tickets [CX-1832 to CX-1904].

Could be a fallback issue with cached results. Recommending we prioritize these for triage.

Flagging for backend support too.

Thanks,  
Anita
