Subject: SmartSearch v2.1 Regression Summary

Hey team,

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of regression results on SmartSearch v2.1:

- iOS: 12 passed / 1 failed (search history edge case)
- Android: 9 passed / 3 failed (scrolling + keyboard input)

Attaching session logs and screenshots in Jira [TCK-241 to TCK-252].  
Escalating the input freeze bug to P1.

Cheers,
