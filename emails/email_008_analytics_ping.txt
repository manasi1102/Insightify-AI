Subject: Drop in SmartSearch usage metrics

Hi folks,

SmartSearch query volume dropped by 18% week-over-week. Breakdown:

- iOS: -9%
- Android: -24%
- Web: stable

Initial hypothesis: crash issue on Android + lag in re-indexing caused poor user experience.

Can someone validate session replay data from Mar 10â€“15?

Cheers,
