Subject: UX pain points in SmartSearch modal

Hey Design,

Based on 2 usability sessions yesterday, a few notes:

1. Users are confused by the dropdown “Filters” vs. “Tags” — can we visually separate them?
2. Placeholder text “Search anything…” isn’t visible on dark mode.
3. No clear error state when SmartSearch returns 0 results.

Will log these in Figma comments too.

Cheers,
