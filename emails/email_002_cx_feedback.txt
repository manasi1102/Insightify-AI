Subject: Rising support queries post-launch

Hi all,

We saw a 34% spike in chat-based support queries after the v2.1 update. The most frequent issue: “SmartSearch returning no results” — especially for older accounts. I'm tagging 48 tickets under `smartsearch-fail`.

Could someone from backend check if legacy index mapping is backward-compatible?

Best,
