Subject: SmartSearch rollout – Android crash reports

Hi team,

We’ve received 27 crash reports on Android 13 devices since the v2.1 SmartSearch launch. QA traced it back to the auto-suggestion debounce logic. Engineering is already working on a patch.

Please prioritize affected tickets and route them to Sprint 14 backlog. Let’s also notify the CX team so they can set expectations on the chat widget.

Thanks,  
Priya  
Product Manager
