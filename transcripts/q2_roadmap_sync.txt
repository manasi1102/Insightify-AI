[2024-03-25 | Q2 Roadmap Sync – Priorities & Experiments]

Priya (PM): Alright team, let’s walk through the major items for Q2. This isn’t final-final yet, but we want alignment before we start scoping anything.

Chris (Analyst): Based on usage data from Q1, the two biggest drop-off points are still search filters and post-query navigation. We need to simplify those flows or risk losing users during high intent.

Karim (UX): That tracks. I’ve been sketching some concepts around progressive disclosure — basically hiding advanced filters by default and layering them in as needed.

Priya (PM): Let’s prioritize that. Simpler search wins. What about SmartSearch personalization?

Chris (Analyst): Good candidate for experimentation. We can A/B static results vs. context-aware ones based on recent activity.

Ravi (QA): If that’s going into prod, we’ll need solid guardrails. Personalization logic is prone to regression if the fallback fails.

Anita (CX): Support already gets confused users saying “Why did my search results change?” A/B is fine, but we’ll need in-app copy that explains it.

Karim (UX): I can add a “Why am I seeing this?” link for test users. We can keep it subtle.

Priya (PM): Awesome. Let’s run the experiment mid-Q2 after we lock down the filter redesign.

Anita (CX): I’d also push for a proper “search history” screen. Users are asking how to revisit old searches, but we’re just caching them now — no UI.

Karim (UX): That’s a low lift. We can reuse the saved items layout and just relabel it.

Chris (Analyst): If we log `search_query_submitted` events with user ID, I can backfill histories for testing.

Priya (PM): Let’s add it to the roadmap under low-effort / high-value wins. Okay, to wrap — filter redesign is top priority, SmartSearch personalization will be our main experiment, and search history UI is a fast follow.

Thanks all. I’ll publish the updated roadmap doc by EOD.

Meeting adjourned.
