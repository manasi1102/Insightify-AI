Subject: User sentiment from reviews (week 1 post-launch)

Hi Insight Team,

Just finished tagging 320 reviews from Play Store and App Store. Here’s a quick sentiment breakdown:

- Positive: 61% – "Feels faster", "Accurate suggestions"
- Neutral: 21% – "Same as old search"
- Negative: 18% – "Can’t find recent docs", "Search stuck"

Key complaint: results relevance drops when query includes numbers or dates (e.g. “invoice 2023”).

Can we flag this to NLP team?

Thanks,
